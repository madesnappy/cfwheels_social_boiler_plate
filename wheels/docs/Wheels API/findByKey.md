# findByKey()

## Description
Fetches the requested record by primary key and returns it as an object. Returns `false` if no record is found. You can override this behavior to return a `cfquery` result set instead, similar to what's described in the documentation for @findOne.

## Function Syntax
	findByKey( key, [ select, include, cache, reload, parameterize, returnAs, callbacks, includeSoftDeletes ] )


## Parameters

	<tbody>
		
		<tr>
			<td>key</td>
			<td>any</td>
			<td>true</td>
			<td></td>
			<td>Primary key value(s) of the record to fetch. Separate with comma if passing in multiple primary key values. Accepts a string, list, or a numeric value.</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td>select</td>
			<td>string</td>
			<td>false</td>
			<td></td>
			<td>Determines how the `SELECT` clause for the query used to return data will look.	You can pass in a list of the properties (which map to columns) that you want returned from your table(s). If you don't set this argument at all, Wheels will select all properties from your table(s). If you specify a table name (e.g. `users.email`) or alias a column (e.g. `fn AS firstName`) in the list, then the entire list will be passed through unchanged and used in the `SELECT` clause of the query. By default, all column names in tables `JOIN`ed via the `include` argument will be prepended with the singular version of the included table name.</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td>include</td>
			<td>string</td>
			<td>false</td>
			<td></td>
			<td>Associations that should be included in the query using `INNER` or `LEFT OUTER` joins (which join type that is used depends on how the association has been set up in your model). If all included associations are set on the current model, you can specify them in a list (e.g. `department,addresses,emails`). You can build more complex `include` strings by using parentheses when the association is set on an included model, like `album(artist(genre))`, for example. These complex `include` strings only work when `returnAs` is set to `query` though.</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td>cache</td>
			<td>any</td>
			<td>false</td>
			<td></td>
			<td>If you want to cache the query, you can do so by specifying the number of minutes you want to cache the query for here. If you set it to `true`, the default cache time will be used (60 minutes).</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td>reload</td>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td>false</td>
			<td></td>
			<td>Set to `true` to force Wheels to query the database even though an identical query may have been run in the same request. (The default in Wheels is to get the second query from the request-level cache.)</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td>parameterize</td>
			<td>any</td>
			<td>false</td>
			<td></td>
			<td>Set to `true` to use `cfqueryparam` on all columns, or pass in a list of property names to use `cfqueryparam` on those only.</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td>returnAs</td>
			<td>string</td>
			<td>false</td>
			<td></td>
			<td>Set this to `query` to return as a single-row query result set. Set this to `object` to return as an object.</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td>callbacks</td>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td>false</td>
			<td>true</td>
			<td>Set to `false` to disable callbacks for this operation.</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td>includeSoftDeletes</td>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td>false</td>
			<td>false</td>
			<td>You can set this argument to `true` to include soft-deleted records in the results.</td>

## Examples
	
		<!--- Getting the author with the primary key value `99` as an object --->
		<cfset auth = model("author").findByKey(99)>

		<!--- Getting an author based on a form/URL value and then checking if it was found --->
		<cfset auth = model("author").findByKey(params.key)>
		<cfif NOT IsObject(auth)>
			<cfset flashInsert(message="Author #params.key# was not found")>
			<cfset redirectTo(back=true)>
		</cfif>

		<!--- If you have a `belongsTo` association setup from `comment` to `post`, you can do a scoped call. (The `post` method below will call `model("post").findByKey(comment.postId)` internally) --->
		<cfset comment = model("comment").findByKey(params.commentId)>
		<cfset post = comment.post()>
